+ The rise of the “just-in-time workforce”: On-demand work, crowdwork and labour protection in the “gig- economy”-Valerio De Stefano
  Also work-on-demand apps are not homogenous: the most relevant distinction can be drawn between apps that match demand and supply of different activities such as cleaning, running errands, home-repairs and other apps that offer more specialised service such as driving, or even some forms of clerical work such as legal services or consultancy (Aloisi, 2015). Some apps can also differentiate services of the same nature, for instance offering car rides at premium or cheaper prices, also trying to accede to different pools of workers (e.g. professional drivers or persons offering rides whilst commuting to and fro other jobs), even if this is not always frictionless (Griswold, 2014).
-A considerable part of this people may be formed by persons that make use of a particular platform or app in their spare time or to maximise the use of an underutilized asset, for instance by offering rides to passengers while commuting to and fro work. In other cases, however, the compensation received from one or more companies in the gig-economy may represent the main or sole source of income for the workers (Hall and Krueger, 2015; Singer, 2014).




+ Copied from a newspaper article of guardian dated march 2020
The problems identified by the think tank fall into three categories: a lack of financial security, a loss of dignity at work, and the inability to progress in a career or train to leave it.
Wasted knowledge plays into the third problem: an inability to see a way out of the flexible life. “I don’t know what comes next as I can’t keep working [gigs] as I can’t get a new car when this one dies,” said a 42-year-old driver from Stoke-on-Trent. “And I don’t have time [to research alternative careers] or go to the gym – sometimes I’m sitting here waiting for a job for an hour and a half!”
+"Defining Employees and Independent Contractors"-By Robert W. Wood 
 The Court suggested criteria for determining if employees are integral to the employers work, including investments the workers make in the business, and whether they stand to gain or lose from their efforts. These new criteria became part of what is known as the "economic reality" test.

The common law definition focuses on the employer's right to direct the means of production. The remaining states use the so-called ABC test, which is broad and includes most workers. The ABC tests three factors are (1) the worker is free from control or direction in the performance of the work; (2) the work is done outside the usual course of the firm's business and is done off the premises of the business; and (3) the worker is custommily engaged in an independent trade, occupation, profes- sion, or business. Unless the worker meets one of the three factors, the worker is considered an employee.
Humans-as-a-service” perfectly conveys the idea of an extreme form of commodification of human beings. Commodification and re-commodification of workers, of course, are not confined to the gig- economy as they concern a much vaster part of the labour market.
Reasons why gig economy exacerbate the above commodification
- transactions that only occur virtually, such as it mainly happens in crowdwork, contribute to hide human activities and workers that structurally operate at the other side of a screen (Irani, 2015b).
  Creation of a new group of “invisible workers”-Phenomenon also shared with domestic work and home work.
- From the theoretical point of view, the risk is that these activities are not even recognised
as work. Indeed, they are often designated as “gigs”, “tasks”, “favours”, “services”, “rides” etc. The terms “work” or “workers” are very scarcely used in this context, and the very same catchphrase “gig-economy” epitomizes this, as the term is often used to indicate a sort of parallel dimension in which labour protection and employment regulation are assumed not to apply by default. 
- eedless to say, income stability remains a mirage for most of the workers in the gig-
economy (Singer, 2014): as praised in the words of one of the businesses’ managers quoted above, one of the chief sources of flexibility is exactly the possibility to hire people and “fire them after [...] ten minutes”. This is all the more serious in countries where basic social instruments such as health insurance and pension plans are mainly provided by employers to regular employees, leaving the rest of the workforce uncovered. The problem is even more widespread if we take into account other social entitlements such as unemployment benefits: in jurisdictions where they are reserved to formerly “employed” persons, most workers that are allegedly self-employed in the gig-economy risk to find themselves excluded from coverage.
+ Developed economies are experiencing the rise of various work arrangements such as zero-hour contracts and on-call labour that afford the possibility to “hire and fire” or, more correctly, to mobilise and demobilise a significant portion of the workforce on an on-demand and “pay-as-you-go” basis (Berg and De Stefano, 2015; Eurofound, 2015; Humblet, forthcoming; Labour Research Department, 2014).

This also adds to the argument that the gig-economy should not be regarded as a separate silo of the labour market, since the problem of misclassification extends much beyond its realm. In the Unites States, the Department of Labour recently issued guidelines to address this general problem in the labour market (US DoL, 2015).

NON-STANDARD FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT “INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, FIXED-TERM CONTRACTS AND OTHER FORMS OF TEMPORARY WORK, TEMPORARY AGENCY WORK AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING MULTIPLE PARTIES, DISGUISED EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, DEPENDENT SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND PART-TIME WORK” (ILO, 2015B, 50).
* CHAPTER 2- PLFS
NEED TO COMPARE BETWEEN 49223 AND 49224 AS UBER AND OLA WILL COME UNDER 49223( THEY ARE PRE BOOKED) WHERE AS TAXI CAN BE TAKEN FROM ROAD SIDE.

+ Can compare to job profile of people who have job security and other employment benifits to gig workers.
+ Another comparision can be between people in different kind of non standard form of employment.- which can be found on the basis of contracts they are involved in.
+ a cross comparision of everything with the survey done before plfs that is nsso survey.
+ Drawing a district map to find agglomeration pattern.

* CHAPTER 3- MY RANDOM THOUGHTS
+18/03/2020 Even if these gig on demand workers are tagged as employess the flexibilbe nature of the work i.e the intermittent nature of their activity can the a hurdle in claiming impotant employment and social benifits like maternity leave, paid holidays etc., as one is accpected to work a minimum lenght of service to claim these rights.
+ Another important factor to look is the differential impact it might have in developing and developed nations - when we talk about empolyment benefits in India the labour which is actually able to claim it is very few prcentage other than that every one else have a bare minimum job security.
+ One more problem they face with collective bargaining is that some time they don't even know who their contractor is.

+ 17/03/2020 A NEED FOR A SYSTEM WHICH KEEP TRACKS OF THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE GIG ECONOMY AND THE KIND OF WORKFORCE THEY BELONG TO. IT SHOULD MADE COMPLUSRY FOR =THESE FIRMS TO GIVE OUT THIS DATA AS THEY CAN EASILY DO THIS. AND THIS CAN PROTECT US FROM THE ASYMETRIC INFORMATION PROBLEM WE ALL FACE IN THE INFORMAL LABOUR MARKET WHERE THERE IS NO ESTIMATE OF THE actual labour force invloved in it.
+ What are the criteria of deciding that a person is an employee or an independent contractor
If we try to analyse this for each app available in India for all the ground worker will the criteria change- as for Uber, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy and other delivery workers the criteria is vaguely same.In case of amazon, Flipkart delivery workers also criteria changes but not vastly. As in the latter case the drivers are hired by the independent contractors who work for all these apps and the independent contractors hire the workers. That's why some time we find the same guy delivering for amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.However as these worker are paid according to the amount of delivery done by them it can be said that they are in a piece wage rate system where as when we talk about Uber Ola Zomato and Swiggy here every worker is the independent contractor. I am using the world independent contractor because these people are not tagged as employees by these firm. But the mind exercise is two challenge these brackets. If we sift to Urban clap now,independent contract tag might be justified but scenario changes because these people are bound to purchase the raw material from urban clap only, so its a kind a subscription scheme they a bound to.Like in some club to enjoy the facility of swimming pool and gym, one need to take the entire membership. otherwise they would not be able to enjoy the benefit associated with it.Similarly the benefit of being on the app is that you get a huge customer base, and you pay the app a commission and you also became the customer of the app by buying the products sold by it.However Urban clap model might be faulty because as everything from the service to customer is being provided by the contractor they can in future make individual relation with the customer and continue with the work.
But similar thing could be done with the Uber/Ola model also. But something is different between the two.
In Uber/Ola the location of the need can change dynamically and hence the requirement of the job and having the personal relationship with the cab driver also will not make the task coast and time efficient.
Where in case of the service provisions like home parlor, Plumber, etc that location of the work will remain same. If it will change also it will be a long term things, which make me think about the sustainable commission for the apps like urban clap and may that's why they take huge commission for connecting both the ends.(I need to find flaw in this argument.)

+  Similar principal in an electronic format- like construction worker. You are looking for work and your employer will choose. Their is an opportunity cost of looking for work. You waiting period is not your leisure period.
Delivery Work- Locally placed work

+ If the future of the work is work from home of all the high end jobs, one need to see it cannot be sustained without gig economy being boosted which in turn means rise in on ground workforce of the gig economy.
So overtime, some policy might come to safe guard their interest mildly however, what is the long term solution to it. The very word gig say something is part time. How are people engaged 24/7 in this part time job. What kind of trap it is. Is their a way out.
Secondly will these jobs also decrease in the future, as everyone will be working from home, so their need to socialise will shift them to go out on their own and engage in buying stuff physically than ordering at home. Or less cab will be required as every one will be working from home.

+ Situations of offline economy being replicated to online economy.
Can their be scope of collective bargaining.
in such thing done in Denmark, Germany.- ways of workers bringing in solidarity.
- who are they going to initiate with it-
-lack of transparency- clients can look for job without revealing who they are.
this does not give worker the choice - it might be a work against their ideology.

* Preliminary data analysis
** Reading the data
Periodic Labour Force Survey is a Unit level data for the first visit and re-visit of Sch. 10.4.
We are analysing the person wise record of visit 1 initially.
Now as I the aim of this research study is analyse the status of the workforce employed in on-ground app-based platform economy.In India, this category of workforce mainly needs to know the skill driving and their task is to deliver either good or human beings. 
So to locate this workforce in the given data set I am using NIC and NCO codes.
NIC codes which seemed relevant for the purpose of this study are -
- 49219 - Other urban or suburban passenger land transport(excluding railways, pipeline, passenger bus transport, tramways, underground or elevated rillways) 
- 49223 - Rental of private cars with drivers.
- 49224 - Taxi Operations
- 49231 - Motoriesed road frieght transport.
- 56104 - Restaurant and bar activities connected to transportation, when carried out by separate units.

If I try to connect each National Industrial Classification code with an internet based application which might be providing on-demand based jobs in this category then -
code 56014 can be related to swiggy,zomato,uber-eats,food panda.
code 49223 and 49224 can be related to uber and ola.
code 49231 and 49219 can be related to the food delivery services mentioned above other than that delivery services provided by the online shopping websites and applications such as - dunzo,amazon,flipkart,myntra,groffers,Bigbasket and many more ecommerce websites, which either outsource their delivery work or have their own set of drivers. Either way the delivery patners are paid on the bais of number of delivery they made or some other model bases on the quantity and valuation of the delivery done.
Though I consider running this analysis without taking data from the observations with NIC code 49231 - because frieght is usually the goods that are transported in bulk.

After analysaing which NIC codes to use, I have done a similar exercise using NCO(National Classification of Occupation) codes. On initial reading I found  code 832 -  to be relevant.

According to the defination of NCO code 241 by the ILO, Business Professional can either be Accountants, Personnel and careers professionals like Adviser, careers
Analyst, job Analyst, occupational Counsellor and Other exmples of buisiness professional were given for people like account executive, advertising analyst, market research home economist etc.
None of these categories come parallel with the category I am Interested in. Most probably these all will be white collar jobs which are prvided by big corporstion in this buisness of transport which can even include App based startups. But than also these are not the people we are looking for in the the study.
Note- Later on I can look at their wages and allowances to confirm my above points.

The defination of NCO code 512 i.e Housekeepers and restraurant service workers is given to include three categories - 1. Housekeepers and related workers, 2. Cooks 2. Waiter, Waiteress and Bartenders
Now NIC code 56104 say it is about restaurant and bar food activities related to transportation.
That should apply these people who are restaurant service workers, their occupation should also be related to transportation.
So, combination of code 512 and 56104 can be a justifiable combination for the purpose of our study.
Although Combination of code 49224 and 512 seems peculiar for our purpose of study as people who are work as housekeepers and restaurant service workers but their industry is taxi operation seems to be the people who might help transport the guest of the restaurant and hotel from one place to another.
So will remove this combination from the study.

Personal care and related worker can be the home based workers, child care workers, institution based care workers but to belong to the industry of urban and suburban passenger transport they need to be a driver most probably and ambulance driver need to be excluded from this category and they have a separate category for them selves.
So code 513 is not usefull for this analysis.

Locomotive engine means either train or metro diver which does not match our requirement.
But they they are coming in combination with industrial classification for taxi operations,rental of private cars with drivers and urban and suburban passenger transport. All these categories does not include railways in them for sure.
So the combination of these to codes is wierd for me.
As other workers also include railway brakers, signallers and shunters which does not seem to have any correlation with the NIC classification they fall under other than the classification of Motorised freight transport.
So the combination of Code 831 and 49231 will be excluded from the analysis for sure.
But Not understanding what to do with the rest three categories.

All the observation in the category are of motor vehicle drivers who are either cab driver, taxi driver, or drive the urban& suburban passenger transport mostly on scheduled routes and times. All the above category consist  a good probability of have workers who are on-demand gig economy workers who work on the ground most providing a delivery or transport service.
But saying the same for Motor Vehicle Driver who work i the industry of Motoriesed Freight transport in difficult.
Be say so we will be assuming the delivery agents who carry those big boxes on their two wheeler doing multiple delivery from one stop to other are freight transporters.
I this seems to a very big assumption, so will be excliding NIC code 49231 from the analysis.

The Freight handlers can be the delivery person who hand grocieries, food, cloths and other parcels. So, taking them into consideration we can look int NCO code 933 - Transport Labourer and freight handler. Now the defination of this category include handle or pedal vehicle drivers, Driver of animal- drawn vehicles and machinery and Freight handlers.
Now the first two categories mentions can only be the part of NIC code 49231 or 49219. 
Again as majority of the task including in freight work is not a part of work done by the dilvery agents of the on-demand based jobs provided by various applications.
Including this category might bring in lot of observation which are out of the study area.
So excluding it seems to be the right action.

If the decision is made to include NIC code 49231 then NCO code 933 will be incuded but only for this combination.

For the present analysis will be using this combination -  NIC code - 49219,49223,49224,56104 and NCO code 832
Combination To think aboubt for inclusion -  + 49231(Motorised Freight Transport) & 933 (Transport Labourer and Freight Handler)

I need to delete[fn:1] this one observation from the data.
All the table above were only for urban sector.

** Sectoral Analysis

Household[fn:2]  definition can be interpreted to say that the migratory workforce will not be considered as a resident of the household where their family resides,howerver they will be a member of a new houshold of their present location for example if a member of the house has come to urban settlement for work purposes,whereas other members of the house stion of stay.
But what about delivery drivers who travel back and forth from their village to city for these jobs, only including urban sector have a fear of missing those observation.
Another, I am not able to think of activity which will be solely done in rural area that belong to these categories.

Looking at these trends was to understand if the greater number of observation in a particular state is not only because of it larger population but their are other reasons behind it.
Like that state has metro cities in it or  have big corporate house as the employer of these corporate house tend to be one the biggest consumers of the services provided by the on-demand workforce that work on the ground. 
Another point of comparision can be the per capita income and state domestic product, as all these services can only be afforded by the relatively affluent section of the society.

Now Maharastra,Tamil Nadu ,Kerela,West Bengal and Uttar pradesh are the top 5 states in terms of the pbservation count for the study population. So Maharastra is the top state for the urban population also so it is not that much of a shocker, however it also complies with the trends discussed above as, Maharashtra is a hub of the biggest corporate house in the Country.
Can go further to understand this with the district composition of Maharastra, Thane and Mumbai Suburban are the districts with highest number of observation. And Mumbai as city with huge in population density, and skewed but very high income level of certain section of the society give the proper space for buisness like uber, ola, zomato, swiggy, grofers, urban clap, etc to grow.

Coming to the second state that is Tamil Nadu,

[fn:2] 1.5.3 Household: A group of persons normally living together and taking food from a common kitchen will constitute a household. It will include temporary stay-aways (those whose total period of absence from the household is expected to be less than 6 months) but exclude temporary visitors and guests (expected total period of stay less than 6 months). Even though the
A-9
Instructions to Field Staff, Vol. I: PLFS
Chapter One Introduction: Coverage, Concepts, Design and Definitions
determination of the actual composition of a household will be left to the judgment of the head of the household, the following procedures will be adopted as guidelines.
(i) Each inmate (including residential staff) of a hostel, mess, hotel, boarding and lodging house, etc., will constitute a single-member household. If, however, a group of persons among them normally pool their income for spending, they will together be treated as forming a single household. For example, a family living in a hotel will be treated as a single household.
(ii) In deciding the composition of a household, more emphasis is to be placed on 'normally living together' than on 'ordinarily taking food from a common kitchen'. In case the place of resi- dence of a person is different from the place of boarding, he or she will be treated as a member of the household with whom he or she resides.
(iii) A resident employee, or domestic servant, or a paying guest (but not just a tenant in the household) will be considered as a member of the household with whom he or she resides even though he or she is not a member of the same family.
(iv) When a person sleeps in one place (say, in a shop or in a room in another house because of space shortage) but usually takes food with his or her family, he or she should be treated not as a single member household but as a member of the household in which other members of his or her family stay.
(v) If a member of a family (say, a son or a daughter of the head of the family) stays elsewhere (say, in hostel for studies or for any other reason), he/ she will not be considered as a member of his/ her parent's household. However, he/ she will be listed as a single member household if the hostel is listed."
